# Space Journey 
Author: Zeyin Lu

Welcome.

## Description
This is my attempt in recreating a “Incredibox” style interactive site, with my own inspiration and interpretation. This site presents a fighter jet that travel through space, with upgrades dragged and dropped onto the jet, along with music. While the music was inspirated by the retro synthwave music, the graphic style is inspirited by Kurzgesagt studio. Hope you all enjoy!
